## Intro

In this part of the repository, you will find a collection of Java projects and exercises focusing on IO operations. The projects cover topics such as reading from and writing to files, working with streams, parsing and formatting data, and handling different file formats like CSV and JSON.

## Projects

1. **FileReaderWriterApp**: A simple Java application that demonstrates how to read data from a text file and write data to another file.

2. **CSVProcessor**: An application that reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and writes the results to another CSV file.


## Usage

To use any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open the project of your interest using your favorite Java IDE.

3. Run the Java application to see the results of the IO operations or the data processing.

Feel free to explore the source code, modify it, and experiment with different IO scenarios.
